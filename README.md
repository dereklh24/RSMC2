# RSMC2

This is an R package that facilitates joint Bayesian inference on an arbitrary non-linear state-space model using SMC2. More detailed information to come in the next few weeks. See (here)[https://dereklh24.github.io/stochastic_volatility.html] for a vignette that demonstrates what this package does.
